# Main Principles

## Mission Statement

To research, develop and propagate quality software and means of raising
the quality of software development throughout communities by applying sustainable and
effective principles and standards to software development, increasing public
awareness and promoting entities that represent a similar philosophy.

## Why?

Because we believe that all people should be happy doing what they do best
and are passionate about, and developers are no exception. In our age of
Informational Technologies, only the lazy would keep themselves ignorant of the
positive aspects that software development brings into their lives. We are not lazy. We are
passionate about all the ways in which programming makes people's lives better,
and consequently we want to make people's lives better through programming.

## How?

By bringing the knowledge, the power, and the tools associated with software
development into the hands of people. By informing and educating the public and
individuals to enable them to use programming in their lives and apply this
knowledge to their specific problems.

## What?

We develop software and software development guidelines using best practices
and industry standards created by the various companies and individuals.
Historically, because our members tend to come from a web development
background, we develop web applications and web standards. However, we would
happily accept other individuals and ideas that are outside of web development.
