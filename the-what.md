# The "What?"

## Programming

We will incarnate your idea into code. Clear, concise, and documented. We will
research and apply best practices and related industry standards. Just simply
reading our code instills a sense of tranquility, and cures many diseases.

## Standards

We will develop standards and supporting code and docs for you, making your
application components inter-operable - even if you can't see why it's necessary
right now. Let's make everything work together!

## Coaching

We will teach you to develop high-quality, standards-compliant applications by
following best practices. Learn how to program, and how to apply your
programming knowledge in your life. Ever wanted to program your fridge? ;)

## Vetting

We will test your staff and candidates' skills and determine their level
and fitness for a specific development area. Not sure if your applicants are
a correct fit? Test them!

## Partnership

If you have resources you need a use for, we can recommend a project of ours or
of one of our friends that you may want to consider funding or co-funding. There
are many great projects out there dying to be brought to life.

## Collaboration

Got an idea, but not sure what to do with it? Whether just a hunch or a
developed plan, you can share it with us, and we will try and help you
make it happen. Join our network of like-minded specialists, entrepreneurs,
and housewives.
